    <p>Howard The Duck</p><hr>
    Howard the Duck is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer Steve Gerber, based very loosely on his college friend Howard Tockman, and artist Val Mayerik. Howard the Duck first appeared in Adventure into Fear #19 (cover-dated Dec. 1973) and several subsequent series have chronicled the misadventures of the ill-tempered anthropomorphic animal trapped on a human-dominated Earth. Echoing this, the most common tagline of his comics reads 'Trapped In a World He Never Made!'.
    <blockquote>
        Howard's adventures are generally social satires, while a few are parodies of genre fiction with a metafictional awareness of the medium. The book is existentialist, and its main joke, according to Gerber, is that there is no joke: "... that life's most serious moments and most incredibly dumb moments are often distinguishable only by a momentary point of view."Gloria Katz, producer of the notorious, ill-fated 1986 film adaptation of the comic, expressed a diametrically opposed opinion of the character, "It's a film about a duck from outer space ... It's not supposed to be an existential experience.
    </blockquote>
    Howard the Duck was portrayed by Ed Gale and voiced by Chip Zien in the critically and commercially unsuccessful 1986 self-titled film. Starting in 2014, the character, voiced by Seth Green, appeared in cameos in several Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films, the Disney XD animated series Guardians of the Galaxy (2015-19) and Ultimate Spider-Man (2016; with Kevin Michael Richardson), and the Disney+ series What If...? (2021-present).

           <h2>Duckworld</h2>
           <p>Born into a family of semi-humanoid ducks and native to Earth-791021, a world of anthropomorphic animals, Howard is happy as a toddler until his younger siblings split his parents’ attention. His creativity stifled, Howard proves to be a mediocre student. His parents wished their first-hatched to rise above the middle class and be a lawyer, though his first aptitude test pegged him as a mortician. Howard underwent a short, undistinguished academic career, graduating four years older if not four years smarter, using his studies to escape the military draft. Dissatisfied with the many careers he tries out, Howard finds himself a perpetual loner, neither noticed nor accepted</p>


           <h2>A Flightless Duck</h2>
           <p>Howard has webbed feet, a bill and feathers, but lacks wings. His neurologic, urogenital, and musculoskeletal systems are anatomically far closer to man than duck, despite the fact that the females of his race are egg-layers. Oddly, Howard cannot swim nor can he fly, since he lacks wings. He also has an inherent dislike of chickens.

            Though he seldom uses it, Howard has mastered the rare martial art Quak Fu, which enabled him to take out a gang of four adult men, and grab a hurled knife or spinning nunchaku out of mid-air. It may be that these abilities were briefly granted to him in a quasi-mystical matter, after which they swiftly faded. 
            
            A surprisingly fierce and capable fighter when his temper flares, Howard is an inconsistent warrior, and he engages in exercise only when he feels like it. While adept at adaptability, Howard cannot assimilate. He is a perpetual malcontent, never truly happy or ever fitting in anywhere.
            
            Howard briefly possessed the magical skills and versions of the paraphernalia of Doctor Strange. For a short time after being bitten by Dracula, Howard had an aversion to sunlight and a pathologic thirst for blood, though he had no superhuman or supernatural powers. Howard briefly utilized a series of voodoo magic items, including the book “Do Do That Voodoo That You Do So Well”, a voodoo doll able to cause pain in others via pin pricks, and the wishbone of a duck, which combined with a spell from the voodoo magic book could summon a team of zombie ducks. Howard has an aptitude for magic, but lacks the interest to pursue this. While holding the Amulet of Pazuzu, Howard was transformed into a gargantuan-breasted killing machine, armed with an extendible wrist blade and wearing mystical armor. He has adopted many other forms, including human, other humanoid animal forms, and even mythical creatures such as a unicorn.
            
            As Iron Duck, Howard wore a suit of armor armed with foot-springs, flame-throwers, a faceplate equipped with windshield wipers, a searchlight, a diamond-tipped drill, and a magnetic uncoupler (which caused the armor to release him instantly). As Duck-Man, Howard used the Duckmobile, able to reach at least 20 mph. It had Duck-jector seats, a Duck-Signal projector, and possibly a few other features, too (Payne loaded it with gimmicks to make their Super Hero show all the more impressive). His costume had a utility belt, though he never used it. </p>
